#  :tomato: Projeto Pomodoro :tomato:

## Project description

A simple pomodoro timer (study or work methods by time) project to apply HTML, CSS and JavaScript concepts, seen in a web development course.

## How does it works

JavaScript has a method wich is possible to call some function every XX milliseconds. 
With this we can make a function that updates a seconds counter every 1000 milliseconds and
when de counter comes to 0, the minutes counter is updated. When the time is up, an alarm is triggered to warn the user.
The user can change the time in options bar, wich is saved by the localStorage method.
I applied media query in css to add some responsiveness in this project.

## Concluding remarks

Just watching a web course and doing some exercises is totally different from getting your hands dirty on some project.
In a project, you encounter some problems which you have no solution. So you need to research, study and ven review some concepts one more time to solve them.
Overall, it was a good initial challenge of learning to be a web developer.
